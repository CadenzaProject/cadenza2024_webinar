# Metrics

In the different challenges of Cadenza, we evaluate the music in terms of their audio quality and/or their intelligibility.

## Audio Quality

The only existing metric for music quality that considers hearing loss is the Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) {cite}`kates2015hearing`.

Please refer to the [Cadenza Learning Resources](https://cadenzachallenge.org/docs/learning_resources/Hearing_aid_processing/edu_HAP_HA_processed_speech#haaqi-hearing-aid-audio-quality-index) to learn more about how HAAQI operates.

## Lyrics Intellibility

Following the approach by {cite}`ibrahim2017intelligibility` and {cite}`sharma2019automatic`, the intelligibility of a song corresponds to the ratio of correctly transcribed words, calculated as the number of correct words in a sentence divided by the total number of words in the sentence.
