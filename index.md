Cadenza Webinar - September 2024
==============================================================

**By Gerardo Roa Dabike**




Welcome, and thank you for joining me in this workshop at [VCCA 2024](https://computationalaudiology.com/events/vcca2024/).
In this workshop, I will share with you some of the key features for effectively 
sharing and collaborating using Git.

## A bit about me

I am a researcher in audio signal processing and machine learning. 
I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Sheffield, UK, 
where I investigated automatic lyrics transcription by adapting 
audio source separation and automatic speech recognition technologies 
designed for spoken speech.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Salford, 
working on the [Cadenza project](https://cadenzachallenge.org/).

## The Cadenza project

In Cadenza, we are exploiting the latest advances in machine learning to 
define how music personalised for someone with a hearing loss should sound like.
For this, we design signal processing and machine learning challenges 
that tackle issues such as music rebalancing and lyrics intelligibility. 
The challenge methodology aims to bring in more research from across different disciplines, 
applying a wider diversity of approaches.

## Objectives of this workshop

This workshop aims to provide you with the necessary tools to share your software,
models, and data with the community. We will cover topics like creating a repository,
making changes, and collaborating with others.
We will start with some basics and then move to more advanced topics that hopefully
will help you in your research and future collaborations.
